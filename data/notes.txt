adjacent_cubes.xml consists of two cubes, centered at [0,0,-1] and [0,0,1] - both cubes have an edge length of 2. 
They are merged at a common face on the xy-plane at z=0 (min z value is -2 and max z value is 2).
Bounds of coordinates are min=[-1,-1,-2] and max=[1,1,2]

The outermost surface has marker value 2, the shared surface has marker value 4
The cube with a smaller z value has marker value 12, the cube with a larger z value has marker value 11
