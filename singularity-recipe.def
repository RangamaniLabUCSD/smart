####### Notes #######
#
# This is a Singularity recipe that adds STUBS to a Docker container 
# with the current development version of FEniCS.
#
# To build an image from this recipe, use the following command (on a
# system where you have sudo access):
# $ sudo singularity build image.simg singularity-recipe.def
#
#
# If you are on Debian/Ubuntu, Singularity can by installed by first 
# enabling the NeuroDebian repository 
# (see instructions at http://neuro.debian.net/) then installing via apt-get.
#
# For example on Ubuntu 20.04 the commands would be:
# $ wget -O- http://neuro.debian.net/lists/focal.us-ca.full | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/neurodebian.sources.list
# $ sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkps://keyserver.ubuntu.com 0xA5D32F012649A5A9
# $ sudo apt-get update
# $ sudo apt-get install -y singularity-container
