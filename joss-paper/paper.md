# Summary

<!-- A summary describing the high-level functionality and purpose of the software for a diverse, non-specialist audience. -->

Biological cells predominantly respond to stimulus by chains of
chemical reactions in a process called *cell signaling* and by way of
*cell signaling pathways*. The propagation of the chemical substances
and the cell signalling pathways can be represented by coupled
nonlinear systems of reaction-transport equations within
intracellular, subcellular and extracellular spaces. The geometries of
real biological cells, subcellular structures such as the endoplasmic
reticulum, as well as the tortuous and narrow extracellular space are
complicated, with highly lobed and segmented morphologies. *Spatial
Modelling Algorithms for Reactions and Transport* (SMART) is a
high-performance finite-element-based simulation package for
describing, modelling and simulating spatially-varying
reaction-transport processes with specific features targeting
signalling pathways in biological cell geometries. SMART is based on
the FEniCS finite element library, provides a symbolic representation
framework for specifying reaction pathways, supports general 2D and 3D
geometry specifications, and supports parallelism via MPI. Its target
audience is ...

# Statement of need

<!-- A Statement of need section that clearly illustrates the research purpose of the software and places it in the context of related work. -->

The traditional approach to modelling cell signalling pathways is to
assume that the substances are well-mixed within the cell body or a
subcellular compartment. In this case, the governing biophysical
equations reduce to ordinary differential equations, for which a
plethora of simulation tools exist [@xxx:20XX; @xxx:20XX]. This
approach has successfully recapitulated many cell-wide signaling
events, from calcium elevations in neurons to models of cell
mechanotransduction. However, such models obviously neglect many
spatial aspects of cell signaling, which are crucially important on
short timescales or for slower diffusing species. Recently, there has
been increased interest in spatiotemporal modeling of cell signaling.
