Ideas for (new) STUBS test cases:

(0) Example 1A [Existing]
    - Idealized Purkinjie neurons
    - Example with two volumes and one interface
    - 3 species
    - Diffusion-linear reactions
    - Use as a guide?!

(1) [Henrik/Jørgen] Meyer et la, Potential for Control of Signaling Pathway ... (2006)
    - Example with analytical solution for the average concentration
    - Geometry: sphere with boundary
    - Concentration: c_A single species
    - Diffusion + first-order reaction
    - Robin-type boundary condition
    - (1a) 2D
    - (1b) 3D

(2) [Henrik/Jørgen?] Ellipsoid 
    - Cunio et al Rangamani, Scientific Reports, 2013,               
    - Geometry: Sphere within sphere/Ellipsoid with ellipsoid
    - Concentration: C 
    - Localized boundary conditions: flux at outer 
    - Diffusion + first-order reaction
    - Neumann-type boundary conditions
    - Measure the norm of the spatial gradient, extent of gradient etc., compare with analytical solution
    - Vary diffusion constant, 

(3) Miriam's paper: more complex boundary reactions
    - Bell, X, Rangamani: 
    - Concentration: Ca2+
    - Diffusion + complex reactions
    - Nonlinear reaction boundary conditions
    - Single 

(4) Purkinjie neuron
    - Same model, 
    - Justin developed simplified case?

(5) Calizo, Bell et al, Scientific Reports, 2020
   - 17 species
   - Multicompartment?
   - Stacks of ER 
   - Cytosolic Calcium

(6) Surface diffusion - toy problem
   - Turing pattern on the surface

(7) Surface diffusion,
    - "Decoding Information in Cell Shape..." ?
