Ideas for (new) SMART test cases:

(0) Example 1A [Existing]
    - Idealized Purkinjie neurons
    - Example with two volumes and one interface
    - 3 species
    - Diffusion-linear reactions
    - Use as a guide?!

    for Control of Signaling Pathways via Cell Size and Shape.”
    Current Biology: CB 16 (17): 1685–93.

    - Example with analytical solution for the average concentration
    - Geometry: sphere with boundary
    - Concentration: c_A single species
    - Diffusion + first-order reaction
    - Robin-type boundary condition
    - (1a) 2D
    - (1b) 3D

(2) [Marie?] Ellipsoid 

    Cugno, Andrea, Thomas M. Bartol, Terrence J. Sejnowski, Ravi
    Iyengar, and Padmini Rangamani. 2019. “Geometric Principles of
    Second Messenger Dynamics in Dendritic Spines.”
    Sci. Rep. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-019-48028-0.

    - Geometry: Sphere within sphere/Ellipsoid with ellipsoid
    - Concentration: C 
    - Localized boundary conditions: flux at outer 
    - Diffusion + first-order reaction
    - Neumann-type boundary conditions
    - Measure the norm of the spatial gradient, extent of gradient etc., compare with analytical solution
    - Vary diffusion constant

(3) More complicated, nonlinear boundary reactions

    Bell et al, Dendritic spine geometry and spine apparatus organization govern
    the spatiotemporal dynamics of calcium, 2019

    - Concentration: Ca2+
    - Diffusion + complex reactions
    - Nonlinear reaction boundary conditions
    - Single 

(4) [Emmet] Purkinjie neuron
    - Same model, simplified clean-version
    - Different species

    N. J. Wong, W. G. M. Janssen, et al. 2020. “Cell Shape Regulates
    Subcellular Organelle Location to Control Early Ca2+ Signal
    Dynamics in Vascular Smooth Muscle Cells.” Scientific Reports 10
    (1): 17866. -- has many cases.
    - 17 species
   - Multicompartment?
   - Stacks of ER 
   - Cytosolic Calcium

(6) Surface diffusion - toy problem
   - Turing pattern on the surface

(7) Surface diffusion,
    - "Decoding Information in Cell Shape..." ?
