            Motivation: Simulation and modeling is becoming a standard approach to understand complex biochemical processes. Therefore, there is a big need for software tools that allow access to diverse simulation and modeling methods as well as support for the usage of these methods.
            Results: Here, we present {COPASI}, a platform-independent and user-friendly biochemical simulator that offers several unique features. We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministic–stochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation.
            Availability: The complete software is available in binary (executable) for {MS} Windows, {OS} X, Linux (Intel) and Sun Solaris ({SPARC}), as well as the full source code under an open source license from .
