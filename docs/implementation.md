# Software implementation

The SMART abstractions and algorithms are implemented via the open source and generally available FEniCS finite element software package (2022-version) {cite}`alnaes2015fenics`. FEniCS supports high-level specification of variational forms via the Unified Form Language (UFL) {cite}`alnaes2014unified`, symbolic differentiation of variational forms e.g.~for derivation for Jacobians, automated assembly of general and nonlinear forms over finite element meshes, and high-performance linear algebra and nonlinear solvers via e.g. PETSc {cite}`balay1998petsc`.
