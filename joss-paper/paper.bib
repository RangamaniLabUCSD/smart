  abstract = {Abstract             Motivation: Simulation and modeling is becoming a standard approach to understand complex biochemical processes. Therefore, there is a big need for software tools that allow access to diverse simulation and modeling methods as well as support for the usage of these methods.             Results: Here, we present COPASI, a platform-independent and user-friendly biochemical simulator that offers several unique features. We discuss numerical issues with these features; in particular, the criteria to switch between stochastic and deterministic simulation methods, hybrid deterministic–stochastic methods, and the importance of random number generator numerical resolution in stochastic simulation.             Availability: The complete software is available in binary (executable) for MS Windows, OS X, Linux (Intel) and Sun Solaris (SPARC), as well as the full source code under an open source license from .

SBML is oriented towards describing biological processes of the sort common in research on a number of topics, including metabolic pathways, cell signaling pathways, and many others. By supporting SBML as an input/output format, different tools can all operate on an identical representation of a model, removing opportunities for translation errors and assuring a common starting point for analyses and simulations. This document provides the specification for               Release 2               of               Version 2               of               SBML Level 3 Core               . The specification defines the data structures prescribed by SBML as well as their encoding in XML, the eXtensible Markup Language.               Release 2               corrects some errors and clarifies some ambiguities discovered in               Release 1               . This specification also defines validation rules that determine the validity of an SBML document, and provides many examples of models in SBML form. Other materials and software are available from the SBML project website at               http://sbml.org/               .}

  abstract = {Abstract                            While many biological processes can be modeled by abstracting away the space in which those processes occur, some modeling (particularly at the cellular level) requires space itself to be modeled, with processes happening not in well-mixed compartments, but spatially-defined compartments. The               SBML Level 3 Core               specification does not include an explicit mechanism to encode geometries and spatial processes in a model, but it does provide a mechanism for SBML               packages               to extend the Core specification and add additional syntactic constructs. The SBML               Spatial Processes               package for SBML Level 3 adds the necessary features to allow models to encode geometries and other spatial information about the elements and processes it describes.},
