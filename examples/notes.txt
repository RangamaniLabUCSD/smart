Here we explore models built using just two different simple kinetic systems + several different mesh topologies.

File and directories are organized as such:
  /exampleXY
    example_XY_model.py    [run this script to generate the .sbmodel file]
    example_XY.sbmodel      [all data necessary for model]
    example_XY_run.py      [driver script - run to simulate the model]
    some_mesh_file.xml     [dolfin format]

X is the type of mesh
 * X=1 : Unit cube (single volume coupled to surface)
 * X=2 : Unit square (single volume coupled to surface 2d)
 * X=3 : Ball embedded within another ball (multi-volume)
 * X=4 : Circle embedded within another circle (multi-volume 2d)
 * X=5 : Adjacent cubes with non-manifold interface (multi-volume with non-manifold mesh)
 * X=6 : Adjacent squares with non-manifold (multi-volume with non-manifold mesh 2d)

Y is the type of kinetics
 * Y=a : Linear degradation of one species (simplest kinetic model)
 * Y=b : Volume molecule A binds to surface molecule B to form complex C
 * Y=c : Volume molecule A in sub-volume 1 binds to surface molecule B to form complex C; complex C gates the amount of molecule D in sub-volume 2 which can pass to sub-volume 1.
 * Y=d : Same model as Y=3 but with molecule E on a surface that is *not* the interface between sub-volumes producing molecule D.

Examples included:
 * example1a (simplest possible model)
 * example1b (simple model showing coupling between volume and surface pdes)
 * example2a (illustrating the same equations work on a 2d mesh with minimal modification)
 * example2b (illustrating the same equations work on a 2d mesh with minimal modification)
 * example3c (illustration of multi-volume models [pdes of two sub-volumes and the pde on the interface surface all coupled together])
 * example4c (same as example33 but showing it also works on a 2d mesh)
 * example5c (same as example33 but showing it works when the surface mesh is non-manifold)
 * example6c (same as exmaple53 but showing it also works on a 2d mesh)
 * example5d (same as example53 but showing that the non-manifold mesh can have pdes on surfaces other than the interface)
 * example6d (same as example54 but showing it also works on a 2d mesh)
